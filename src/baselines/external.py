"""Adapters for baselines that live in external packages or notebooks.

Each wraps a method that is *not* vendored here, and raises a clear message
naming what to install or extract if it is missing. Kept deliberately thin --
the point is a uniform ``fit``/``transform``/``loadings`` surface, not a
reimplementation.

    * its decoder is nonlinear (``DecoderSCVI`` with a softmax scale
