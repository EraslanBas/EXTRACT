"""Export ranked gene lists for pathway over-representation analysis.

Deliberately thin: this writes the ranked lists and defers to the existing KEGG
ORA pipeline in ``ChemoGeneticScreens`` rather than reimplementing enrichment.

Run the two tails separately. Factor sign is arbitrary unless anchored
(:func:`extract.interpret.loadings.anchor_signs`), so an unsigned or
mis-oriented single list will conflate "genes this factor raises" with "genes it
lowers".
