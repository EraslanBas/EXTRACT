"""On-target-masked reconstruction error, averaged over rows.

The per-row error (``GlobalLoadings.squared_error``) is the masked squared
residual divided by the number of retained genes; this averages it over a
batch's rows. Every row weighs the same: all rows of a pair are exchangeable,
and the model never uses cell counts.
