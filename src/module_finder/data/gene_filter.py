"""Drop genes no perturbation moved, in any context.

A gene that no perturbation in the panel shifted anywhere is not part of any
latent factor that was active in any context, so it contributes nothing but
noise to the factorisation. Counting how many perturbations moved each gene, and
requiring a minimum, removes those.

The count is over ``(perturbation, context)`` pairs, summed across contexts, and
it uses each pair's **full-data row only**. The eleven subsample rows of a pair
are re-estimates of the same quantity, so counting them would multiply every
gene's count by roughly eleven without adding information, and would count a
gene as "affected in many perturbations" when one poorly powered perturbation
happened to cross the threshold in several of its own subsamples.

"Affected" has to be a magnitude threshold, because the built matrices carry
``PosteriorMean`` and not ``lfsr``. That threshold is part of the definition, not
an incidental default: ``ashr`` shrinks unsupported entries to near zero, so the
count is stable for thresholds well above the shrinkage floor and grows quickly
below it.
