"""The ChemoGeneticScreens shrunken-logFC pipeline, vendored unchanged.

These are the scripts that generated the published ``PosteriorMeanMatrices/``.
They are standalone CLIs, not importable helpers -- driven by
``RunAshrPipeline.sh``, which chains all four steps per input ``.h5ad``:

1. ``ComputeSE.py``          cell-level -> per-perturbation ``mean_diff`` + Welch
                             ``se``, written as ``chunk_%06d.csv``
                             (byte-identical to
                             ``ChemoGeneticScreens/SRC/PythonScripts/ComputeSE.py``)
2. ``run_ashr_on_chunk.R``   ``ash(a$mean_diff, a$se)`` per chunk, so the
                             empirical-Bayes prior is fitted per 100
                             perturbations
3. ``MergeAshrRes.py``       merge perturbation/gene metadata back into the ashr
                             output
4. ``AshrGenerateMatrix.py`` pivot to the wide perturbation x gene
                             ``PosteriorMean`` matrix

Usage::

    OUT_BASE=data/posterior_matrices \\
      src/module_finder/de/RunAshrPipeline.sh /path/to/one.h5ad /path/to/two.h5ad

**Requires R with ``ashr``.** It is not installed in this environment; step 2
fails without ``R -e 'install.packages("ashr")'``.

Two Python modules here are not part of the original pipeline, and neither does
any differential expression:

* ``arms.py``  builds the *augmented input* -- one label per intended matrix row
  (``<pert>`` for the full estimate, ``<pert>__sub<k>`` for subsamples), so full
  and subsampled results land in the same matrix and the same ashr fit.
* ``api.py``   one call that chains input construction -> ``RunAshrPipeline.sh``
  -> matrix + per-row cell counts.
